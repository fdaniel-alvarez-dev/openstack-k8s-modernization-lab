# Deployment Pattern: Kubernetes Baseline

## Baseline scope
- Namespaces, RBAC, and a policy baseline for critical clusters.
- Standard labels and ownership tags.
- Release cadence and upgrade validation.

## Why it matters
Standardization reduces operational variance and improves reliability and auditability.
